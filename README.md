# README

## Introduction

This repo includes the analysis for an AB test done in simple probability terms, using a z-test and by creating logistic regression models.

## Requirements

### Libraries

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest
```

### Files

Both .csv files needed are included in the repo.

## Scientific Basis

This repo was done to illustrate how to do an A/B hypothesis testing using more than 1 moethod.

1. Using simple probability caluclations.
2. Performing A/B manually
3. Performing A/B testing using z-test method from statsmodels library
4. Performing a logistic regression model from statsmodels library

I have added some background on the more advanced concepts, but basic knowledge of _probability_ and _binomial distribution_ is better.
